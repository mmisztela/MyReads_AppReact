# MyReads App 

This App was created as a procjet for the Udacity React Program. It's a virtual bookcase unit that allows you to organize your books into 3 categories:
1. Currently Reading;
2. Want to Read;
3. Read (books you have already read).


In order to install and use the MyReads App:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


How to use MyReads App:
1. To search and add a book to any category click on the "+" button in the right bottom corner, you can search either by title or author;
2. Once you find the book click on the button on the book cover to add it to desired category;
3. If you want to move the book from one shelf to another, click on the button on the book cover and pick a diffrent category. To remove book from your virtual bookcase pick "none' as a option. 

Enjoy!
